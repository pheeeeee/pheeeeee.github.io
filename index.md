Hi, I am a master student in the [the Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.yonsei.ac.kr/stat/index.do) at Yonsei University, advised by [Yong-Ho Jeon](https://stat.yonsei.ac.kr/faculty/name_search.do?mode=view&userId=zLn7yUITMUoRCLHT7RciHQ%3D%3D&sosokcd=) and [Kyung-ho Yoon](https://sites.google.com/view/yoonlabyonsei/professor).

My research interests lie broadly in mathematical backgrounds of Machine Learning. Currently my focus is on the distributional robustness of machine learning.

Beyond Academics, I love sports and traveling.
