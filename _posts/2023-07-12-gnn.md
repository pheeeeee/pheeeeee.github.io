$G = (V,E) $ is a graph. Let $ A $ be an adjency matrix of a graph G. <br>
There are 3-Levels of learning tasks.<br>
1. Node level
2. Link level
3. Structure level

<h5>Node Features</h5>
Intro : Given the classes of some nodes, we want to know the class of other nodes.
#### 1. Node Centrality
- Eigenvalue Centrality <br>
Intuition : Node is important if its neighborhood is important.<br>
$u_{s} = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{v \in N(s)} u_{v} $ ($\lambda$ is the normalizing constant.) <br>
$\lambda u = Au$ where A is adjencey matrix. Thus, $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue of A. 
By Perron-Frobenius Theorem, since all the elements of A are non-negative the largest eigenvalue is positive.
We usually choose eigenvector u corresponding to the largest eigenvalue as node centrality.
