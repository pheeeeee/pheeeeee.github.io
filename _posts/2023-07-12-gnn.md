$G = (V,E) $ is a graph. Let $ A $ be an adjency matrix of a graph G. <br>
There are 3-Levels of learning tasks.<br>
1. Node level
2. Link level
3. Structure level

<h5>Node Features</h5>
Intro : Given the classes of some nodes, we want to know the class of other nodes.
#### 1. Node Centrality
- **Eigenvalue Centrality** <br>
Node is important if its neighborhood is important.<br>
$u_{s} = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{v \in N(s)} u_{v} $ ($\lambda$ is the normalizing constant.) <br>
$\lambda u = Au$ where A is adjencey matrix. Thus, $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue of A. 
By Perron-Frobenius Theorem, since all the elements of A are non-negative the largest eigenvalue is positive.
We usually choose eigenvector u corresponding to the largest eigenvalue as node centrality.

- **Betweenness Centrality**<br>
Node is important if it lies on many shortest paths.<br>
$u_{s} = \sum_{v \neq s \neq w} \frac{\text{# shortest path paths between v and w that pass through s}}}{\text{# shortest paths between v and w}} $

- **Closeness Centrality**<br>
Node is important if it has small shortest path lengths to all other nodes.<br>
$u_{s} =  \frac{1}{\sum_{v \neq s}\text{shortest path length between v and s}}$

- **Clustering Coefficients**<br>
Node is important if connected to many neighboring nodes.<br>
$e_{v} = \frac{\text{# edges among neighboring nodes}}{k_{v} \text{choose} 2}$
It counts the number of triangles that a node touches.

- **Graphlets**<br>
Count the number of pre-specified subgraphs with the given node.
