<h2> Intro </h2>
Some questions and motivations why I studied this subject. : Can machines predict deterministic yet chaotic system? Can we distinguish noise from structural chaos from given data? Can machines recognize patterns from highly patternless system?
<br/>
To answer these questions, one needs to understand and define what patternless is. Many mathematicians defined the notion of patternless as chaos. Good definitions  
<br/>

<h2> Notations and Prerequisites </h2>
def) x is fixed point of f if $f(x) = x$
<br/>
<br/>

##### Proposition
Let p be a fixed point of f. If $|f'(p)| < 1$, then there exists a neighbourhood U of p such that, for all x in U, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f^{n}(x) = p. Such fixed point p is called attracting fixed point and the set U is a stable set. When $|f'(p)| > 1$, then p is called repelling fixed point. When $|f'(p)| = 1$, p is saddle point.
