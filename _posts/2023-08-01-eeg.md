### International 10-20 system


Anterior-Posterior Bipolar Montage

Common Average Reference Montage



#### Common EEG Pattern

1. Eye Blink

Bell's phenomenon -> large 

2. Alpha rhythm : 10 Hz

3. Focal Epileptiform Discharges


#### Diagnoistic Yield

2 major determinants of detecting scalp abnormality:
1. Area of cortex involved : In general, 10-20 cm^2 of cortex must be involved to be detected on scalp eeg. 
2. Location : If deeper cortex is invelved, abnormality is harder to be detected.


#### Polarity Rules

The differential amplifier : 2 input -> 1 output as difference.
