Hi, I am a master student in the [the Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.yonsei.ac.kr/stat/index.do) at Yonsei University, advised by [Yong-Ho Jeon](https://stat.yonsei.ac.kr/faculty/name_search.do?mode=view&userId=zLn7yUITMUoRCLHT7RciHQ%3D%3D&sosokcd=). 

My research interests lie broadly in mathematical backgrounds of Machine Learning. Currently my focus is on Ergodic Theory and Functional data. My work is generously supported by an Brain Korea 21. Prior to my graduate program, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with minor in Applied Statistics from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/sc/index.jsp). I did my undergraduate scholar internship at [Knowledge Fusion Artificial Intelligience(KFAI)](https://kfai.yonsei.ac.kr/home) in the Industrial Engineering department at Yonsei University.
